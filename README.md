# ü¶ä What is get_next_line?

Reading a line on a fd is way too tedious...

The aim of this project is to code a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. Returns the following line when called again.

# ‚öíÔ∏è Compilation

1. Remove the comment from the main function in `get_next_line.c`.
2. Run `cc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c`, you can set the BUFFER_SIZE's value to your heart's content.
3. Run with `./a.out`.
